Abstract 
>>
Eye diseases can significantly affect a person’s vision
and quality of life. Eye diseases continue to rise, this increase can
be linked to the factor like increase in screen time, unhealthy
lifestyle, exposure to radiations and other health issues like
diabetics. Some of the common eye diseases include Diabetic
Retinopathy, Cataract and Glaucoma. As per WHO cataract is
one of the major causes for blindness and visual impairment in
the world. However, if these diseases are detected at an early stage
they can be treated. Deep Learning techniques has shown great
potential in detecting such diseases. In this study we use propose
a deep learning approach based on a Convolutional Neural
Network (CNN) architecture, to detect diabetic retinopathy,
cataract, and glaucoma. The dataset comprises of 4217 retinal
images which is divided into train and test sets. To ensure
robustness and to prevent over fitting, the dataset is trained using
K-Fold cross-validation. We have used accuracy, precision, recall,
and F1-score to evaluate the performance of our model.
